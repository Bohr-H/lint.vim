JavaScriptLint.vim is a Vim plugin that allows the JavaScript Lint (jsl) 
program from http://www.javascriptlint.com to be tightly integrated with 
Vim.  Once installed, the contents of a javascript file will be passed 
through the jsl program after the file's buffer is saved.  Any lint 
warnings will be placed in the quickfix error window.
